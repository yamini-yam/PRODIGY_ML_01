**Introduction**

Welcome to my house price prediction project! In this project, the goal is to predict the price of a house based on its features using a machine learning model. The dataset contains information about various houses, including their size (square footage), number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. I have developed a linear regression model to estimate house prices based on these features. This project involves training the model, saving it, and creating an interactive web application to make predictions.

**Data Overview**

The dataset used in this project includes features such as:

**Square Footage (sqft_living):** The living area of the house in square feet.

**Number of Bedrooms (bedrooms)**:The number of bedrooms in the house.

**Number of Bathrooms (bathrooms):** The number of bathrooms in the house.

Price (price): The target variable representing the price of the house.
I conducted basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and distributions. This included checking for missing values and visualizing data distributions to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable.

**Model Development**

For this project, I implemented a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices. Here is a brief overview of the steps involved:

**Data Preparation:** Split the data into training and test sets.

**Model Training:** Trained a linear regression model on the training data.

**Model Saving:** Saved the trained model using joblib for later use.

**Web Application**
An interactive web application has been created using Streamlit. The app allows users to input the features of a house (square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms) and obtain an estimated price prediction. The Streamlit interface is designed to be user-friendly and provides real-time predictions based on the trained model.

**Future Enhancements**

As this is an initial project, there are several areas for improvement:

Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations to improve model performance.
Model Enhancement: Experiment with more complex models and techniques, such as polynomial regression or ensemble methods.
User Interface: Enhance the Streamlit application with more features or visualizations to improve user experience.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict house prices. By leveraging a linear regression model and developing an interactive web application, I have provided a practical tool for estimating house values based on key features. This project serves as a foundational step in understanding and applying machine learning in real-world scenarios.
